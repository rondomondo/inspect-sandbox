description: >
    Inspects a Linux container or sandbox environment and produces a structured
    HTML report and downloadable PDF covering filesystem mounts, process security
    context, network configuration, available runtimes, and running processes.
    Use this skill whenever the user asks to inspect, audit, probe, or explore a
    sandbox or container environment -- including questions like "what tools are
    available here?", "what network access does this have?", "what's the security
    context?", "show me what's mounted", or "give me an environment report". Also
    trigger when the user asks what capabilities, runtimes, or filesystem layout
    the current environment has.

# Sandbox Inspector

Automated environment inspection that parses system state into a self-contained HTML viewer with collapsible sections, category filters, and rendered Mermaid diagrams. When running inside the Claude sandbox, the full output is packaged into a downloadable zip that the user can run locally with a single command. A multi-page landscape A4 PDF of all text sections is also rendered via Playwright and presented inline in the chat client.

---

## MANDATORY: Always Use `make inspect`

**`make inspect` MUST always be run.** Never call `sandbox_inspect.sh` or `generate_diagrams.py` directly. The `make inspect` target is the only supported entry point -- it orchestrates the full pipeline in the correct order:

1. **Stop**: Kills any stale server
2. **Inspection**: Runs `sandbox_inspect.sh` -> timestamped `output/sandbox/report_*.txt` + `latest` symlink
3. **Diagrams**: Runs `generate_diagrams.py` -> `output/sandbox/diagram_*.md` + `diagrams.json`
4. **Serve + Open**: Starts the HTTP server and opens `inspector.html` in the default browser

Calling scripts individually will produce incomplete or inconsistent output. `make inspect` is the contract -- use it.

---

## Production Workflow

### 1. Run the Inspection

```bash
make inspect
```

This is the only step needed. The full pipeline runs automatically.

### 2. Post-inspection: Sandbox Bundle (IS_SANDBOX=yes)

After `make inspect` completes, check the environment:

```bash
echo "${IS_SANDBOX:-no}"
```

If `IS_SANDBOX=yes`, the HTML viewer cannot be served directly -- there is no browser. Instead, perform steps 3a-3e to build a downloadable zip the user can run locally.

#### 3a. Render Mermaid diagrams

`generate_diagrams.py` writes `.md` files containing fenced Mermaid blocks. These must be rendered to SVG before packaging. In the sandbox, use `mmdc` directly (Docker is unavailable):

```bash
cat > /tmp/puppeteer-config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "executablePath": "/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome",
  "args": ["--no-sandbox", "--disable-setuid-sandbox"]
}
EOF

for md in output/sandbox/diagram_*.md; do
    base="${md%.md}"
    mmdc -i "$md" -o "${base}.svg" --puppeteerConfigFile /tmp/puppeteer-config.json
done
```

`mmdc` produces files named `diagram_<key>-1.svg` (one per diagram block). `generate_diagrams.py` detects this naming automatically -- if the mmdc output files exist on disk it uses `diagram_<key>-1.svg` in `diagrams.json`; if the Docker wrapper naming (`diagram_<key>.svg-1.svg`) is found instead it uses that. This means rendering can happen before or after the diagrams step without manual intervention.

If Chromium is not at the expected path:

```bash
find /opt/pw-browsers -name "chrome" | grep -v headless | head -1
```

#### 3b. Render PDF

Run `screenshot_report.py` from the skill working directory. It patches `inspector.html` to inline all data (bypassing `fetch()`), stubs out mermaid, loads it via `file://` in Playwright/Chromium, then renders all text sections as a single multi-page landscape A4 PDF.

```bash
python3 scripts/screenshot_report.py --out-dir output/sandbox
```

This produces `output/sandbox/sandbox-report.pdf` -- one A4 landscape page per CSS page-break, covering all five text sections (filesystem, security, network, processes, runtime). The diagrams tab is intentionally excluded: its Mermaid SVGs are built for interactive pan/zoom and paginate badly in print.

**Why file:// + inline data?** Playwright's Chromium sandbox blocks loopback connections (`ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED`), so an HTTP server on localhost won't work. The script patches `inspector.html` with all report data inlined and a `fetch()` interceptor, loads it as `file://`, renders the PDF, then deletes the patched file.

Optional args:

- `--width 1400` -- viewport width in px before PDF scaling (default: 1400)

If Chromium is not found at the default path (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`), the script auto-detects it. Manual fallback:

```bash
find /opt/pw-browsers -name "chrome" | grep -v headless | head -1
```

#### 3c. Create `serve.sh`

Write a launcher script to the `output/sandbox/` working directory (it will be promoted to the zip root in step 3e):

```bash
cat > output/sandbox/serve.sh << 'SCRIPT'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# serve.sh -- Start a local HTTP server to view the sandbox inspection report
# Usage: ./serve.sh [PORT]   (default port: 8008)
# Then open: http://localhost:8008/index.html?v=$(date +%s)
set -euo pipefail
PORT="${1:-8008}"
DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
echo "Starting sandbox report viewer..."
echo "  URL: http://localhost:${PORT}/index.html?v=$(date +%s)"
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop."
cd "$DIR"
python3 -m http.server "${PORT}"
SCRIPT
chmod +x output/sandbox/serve.sh
```

#### 3d. Create `README.md`

Write a README to `output/sandbox/` (also promoted to zip root in step 3e). It must cover:

- Full listing of zip contents with a description of each file
- How to run `serve.sh` and open the viewer (`http://localhost:8008/index.html?v=<timestamp>`)
- Alternative server options: `python3 -m http.server`, `npx serve`, VS Code Live Server
- Explicit note that `inspector.html` **must** be served over HTTP -- opening it as a `file://` URL will not work because it uses `fetch()` to load report data
- Note that `report.txt` is available as a plain-text fallback requiring no server

#### 3e. Assemble and zip

**SECURITY CHECK -- do this before zipping:** Scan `output/sandbox/report.txt` for any unredacted secrets before packaging. The inspection script masks known patterns, but operator-injected variables with unusual names may slip through. Run:

```bash
grep -iE '(KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD|PASSWD|CREDENTIAL|AUTH|API_|_API|PRIVATE)=' output/sandbox/report.txt \
    | grep -v '\*\*\*REDACTED\*\*\*' \
    && echo "WARNING: possible unredacted secrets above -- do NOT zip" \
    || echo "OK: no obvious unredacted secrets found"
```

If the check prints any lines above the warning, manually redact those lines in `report.txt` before proceeding. Never zip or share any artifact that contains unmasked credentials.

The zip must follow this exact directory structure:

```
sandbox-inspection.zip
├-- README.md            <- user instructions
├-- index.html           <- the HTML viewer
├-- serve.sh             <- one-command local server launcher
└-- vendor/
    └-- js/
        └-- mermaid.min.js      <- for rendering the mermaid diagrams
└-- output/
    └-- sandbox/
        ├-- report.txt          <- raw plain-text inspection output (copied from latest)
        ├-- diagrams.json       <- diagram manifest consumed by inspector.html
        ├-- diagram_network.md
        ├-- diagram_network-1.svg
        ├-- diagram_mounts.md
        ├-- diagram_mounts-1.svg
        ├-- diagram_runtime.md
        ├-- diagram_runtime-1.svg
        ├-- diagram_security.md
        ├-- diagram_security-1.svg
        └-- sandbox-report.pdf  <- multi-page A4 landscape PDF of all text sections
```

`index.html` lives at the zip root and fetches data from the relative path `output/sandbox/` -- this is why the hierarchy matters. `serve.sh` must also be at the root so it serves from the same directory as `index.html`.

Use a staging directory to assemble the layout, then zip from inside it so no extra path prefix is introduced:

```bash
STAGE=/tmp/sandbox-inspection-stage
rm -rf "$STAGE" && mkdir -p "$STAGE/output/sandbox" && mkdir -p "$STAGE/vendor/js"
SRC=output/sandbox

# Promote these to the zip root
cp inspector.html           "$STAGE/"
cp inspector.html           "$STAGE/index.html"
cp "$SRC/README.md"         "$STAGE/"
cp "$SRC/serve.sh"          "$STAGE/"
cp vendor/js/mermaid.min.js "$STAGE/vendor/js/"

# Data files stay under output/sandbox/
cp "$(python3 -c "import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$SRC/latest")" "$STAGE/output/sandbox/report.txt"
cp "$SRC/diagrams.json"      "$STAGE/output/sandbox/"
cp "$SRC"/diagram_*.md       "$STAGE/output/sandbox/"
cp "$SRC"/diagram_*-1.svg    "$STAGE/output/sandbox/"
cp "$SRC/sandbox-report.pdf" "$STAGE/output/sandbox/"

cd "$STAGE"
zip -r /mnt/user-data/outputs/sandbox-inspection.zip .
```

### 4. Presenting Results

Always summarise key findings inline regardless of environment: identity & privilege level, Linux capabilities, writable paths, network posture (egress proxy, outbound connectivity), and available runtimes.

**In sandbox** (`IS_SANDBOX=yes`):

1. Present `sandbox-report.pdf` and `sandbox-inspection.zip` via `present_files`. Tell the user to unzip and run `./serve.sh`, then open `http://localhost:8008/index.html?v=<timestamp>` (the cache-buster `v` param is printed by `serve.sh`).
2. Rasterise PDF pages with `pdftoppm` and `view` each resulting `.jpg` so the user gets an immediate visual preview in chat without downloading anything:

```bash
# Replace N with the actual last page number (or omit -l entirely to rasterise all pages)
pdftoppm -r 120 -jpeg -f 1 -l N output/sandbox/sandbox-report.pdf /tmp/pdf_preview
# then view each /tmp/pdf_preview-*.jpg
```

**Outside sandbox**: use `make inspect` (which stops any stale server first) to launch `inspector.html` directly in the default browser.

---

## How the Downloaded Bundle Works

When the user downloads and unzips `sandbox-inspection.zip` they get a self-contained report package. Here is what each piece does:

**`index.html`** -- the interactive viewer. It loads `output/sandbox/report.txt` and `output/sandbox/diagrams.json` via `fetch()`, parses them into collapsible sections, and renders the Mermaid SVGs inline. Starts in light mode. Has a dark/light toggle. Because it relies on `fetch()` it must be served over HTTP, not opened directly as a file.

**`serve.sh`** -- a minimal Python 3 HTTP server launcher. Running `./serve.sh` (or `./serve.sh 9090` for a custom port) starts serving from the unzipped directory and prints the URL. Requires only Python 3, which is present on any modern Mac, Linux, or WSL environment.

**`output/sandbox/report.txt`** -- the raw plain-text inspection output. Readable in any terminal or text editor without a server. Useful for quick reference or diffing across environments.

**`output/sandbox/sandbox-report.pdf`** -- multi-page landscape A4 PDF covering all five text sections. Viewable in any PDF reader without a server. Produced by `screenshot_report.py`.

**`output/sandbox/diagrams.json`** -- manifest that maps diagram keys to their SVG filenames. `index.html` reads this to know which images to display and where.

**`output/sandbox/diagram_*.md`** -- Mermaid source for each diagram. Renderable independently in VS Code (Mermaid Preview extension) or on GitHub.

**`output/sandbox/diagram_*-1.svg`** -- pre-rendered SVG diagrams. Displayed inline by the viewer; also openable standalone in any browser.

## Development & Quality Control

- **Formatting**: `make format` (Black + Isort)
- **Linting**: `make lint` (Ruff with auto-fix)
- **Testing**: `make test` (Pytest with coverage)
- **Cleanup**: `make clean` (removes `output/sandbox/` and venv)
- **Packaging**: `make zip` (bundles the skill source for distribution)

---

## Error Handling & Constraints

- **Venv missing**: `check-venv` target will error. Run `make install` first.
- **Script failures**: if `sandbox_inspect.sh` exits non-zero the pipeline halts -- no partial report.
- **Port conflicts**: `make serve` defaults to `8008`. Override with `PORT=9090 make serve`.
- **PDF failures**: if `screenshot_report.py` fails, the zip can still be produced without the PDF -- note the failure to the user and present the zip anyway. The PDF is additive; it doesn't block the primary deliverable.
- **Diagrams tab excluded from PDF**: the Mermaid SVGs in the diagrams tab are built for interactive pan/zoom and paginate very badly in print (mostly blank pages). This is by design -- the SVGs are fully available in the zip and interactive HTML viewer.
- **Chromium path changed**: the script auto-detects via `find /opt/pw-browsers -name "chrome" | grep -v headless`. If auto-detect fails, update `CHROMIUM_DEFAULT` in the script.
- **Loopback connections blocked**: do NOT use an HTTP server for PDF rendering -- Playwright's Chromium sandbox blocks `ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED` on localhost. Always use the file:// + inline-data approach in `screenshot_report.py`.
- **index.html as file://**: will silently fail to load data -- `fetch()` is blocked on `file://` origins in most browsers. Must be served over HTTP.
- **SVG naming mismatch**: `generate_diagrams.py` checks for both `diagram_<key>-1.svg` (mmdc) and `diagram_<key>.svg-1.svg` (Docker wrapper) and writes whichever exists into `diagrams.json`. If neither exists yet (diagrams not yet rendered), it defaults to the mmdc name -- re-run `generate_diagrams.py` after rendering if needed.
- **Blank 1-page PDF**: caused by `inspector.html` loading mermaid via `<script src="vendor/js/mermaid.min.js">`, which cannot resolve as a relative path under `file://`. This aborts app init before `fetch()` fires. Fixed in `screenshot_report.py` by replacing the `<script src=...>` tag with a lightweight stub: `window.mermaid = {initialize(){}, run(){}, contentLoaded(){}}`. The diagrams tab is excluded from the PDF so mermaid doesn't need to work -- it just must not throw. **Do NOT inline the full `mermaid.min.js` as a `<script>` block**: at ~3 MB of minified JS with no newlines, Chromium's PDF renderer treats it as visible body text, producing pages of garbage output.
- **`_in_sandbox()` returning False on Firecracker VMs**: the function checks `IS_SANDBOX` env var first, then `/.dockerenv` and `/run/.containerenv`. Firecracker VMs set `IS_SANDBOX=yes` but have neither marker file. If `_in_sandbox()` returns False incorrectly, the script falls through to `_docker_available()` which crashes if `docker` is not on PATH.
- **`docker` not on PATH crash**: `_docker_available()` guards with `shutil.which("docker")` before invoking it. If docker is absent it returns False cleanly rather than raising `FileNotFoundError`.
